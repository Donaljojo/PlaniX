# PlaniX — Secure Development & Planning Assistant

---

PlaniX – AI-Powered Secure Development & Planning Platform

PlaniX is an AI-integrated platform designed to help developers, engineers, and security professionals plan, design, and evaluate secure software systems from the ground up.
It streamlines secure system design, threat modeling, cost estimation, and security testing strategy — all inside a single, intelligent web application built using Python Django and deployed in GitHub Codespaces.

🚀 Project Overview

Modern software development faces challenges like insecure architectures, unclear threat models, unpredictable cost estimation, and scattered security practices. PlaniX solves these issues by providing an AI-powered Secure Development & Planning Assistant that generates:

Secure architecture recommendations

Threat models (OWASP/STRIDE aligned)

Security best practices

Cost estimates for cloud & infrastructure

Security testing strategies

SDLC + DevSecOps guidance

Full downloadable reports


PlaniX is built for developers, students, and security engineers who need fast, consistent, and reliable security planning in one place.
